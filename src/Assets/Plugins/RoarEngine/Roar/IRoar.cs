 *
 * \subsection what_is_roar What is Roar?
 *
 * %Roar is a configurable game mechanics platform.<br/>
 * You can access the creation tools from the Admin dashboard.<br/>
 *
 * \subsection what_is_roar_unity What is the Roar Unity SDK used for?
 *
 * The Unity SDK provides a wrapper around the %Roar Web API, making it easier to interact with a %Roar game server from your Unity game.
 * Should you desire to do so, you can roll your own code that uses the Web API directly.
 * However if your game is built with Unity, we recommend the use of the %Roar Unity SDK and welcome any open source contributions to it.
 *
 * \section sdk_basics Roar Unity SDK Basics
 *
 * The two key objects within the %Roar Unity SDK are the interface IRoar (found in IRoar.cs and implemented in DefaultRoar.cs) and the class that provides event management – RoarManager (found in RoarManager.cs).
 *
 * \subsection iroar_interface The IRoar Interface
 *
 * The IRoar interface is what game developers use to interact with their %Roar game on the server.
 * IRoar is composed of a number of component interfaces each representing a distinct area of game functionality.
 * The following table lists each component, clicking on a component name will show more detailed class level documentation.

 * \subsection roar_manager RoarManager
 *
 * The Unity %Roar SDK handles responses from the server by using a two pronged approach. Some %Roar functions take a callback function as the last argument, this callback function is executed when the %Roar server response has been received and processed by the Unity SDK. However, some events occur on the server and must be subscribed to via event handling functions. Where possible both approaches are made available to the developer e.g. if an authentication attempt fails, it could be handled by:
 *
 * subscribing a login failed function to the logInFailedEvent
 *
 * <code>
 * RoarManager.logInFailedEvent += onLoginFailed;
 * function onLoginFailed(msg) {
 *  ...
 * }
 * roar.login(username, password);
 * </code>
 *
 * or by passing a login failed callback function to the authenticate function
 *
 * <code>
 * roar.login(username, password, function(cb_info:Roar.CallbackInfo){
 *   // cb_info.code
 *   // cb_info.message
 * });
 * </code>
 *
 * Notice how the function is defined within the login function's argument list; this is an anonymous function. Callbacks can (but don't have to) be anonymous functions.
 *
 * The RoarManager class documentation contains a list of all the events that can be subscribed to.
 *
 *
 * \section troubleshooting Troubleshooting
 *
 *
 * Most %Roar API calls require an <strong>auth_token</strong> (authentication token). The auth token is automatically retrieved when a player is authenticated.
 *
 * If you are experiencing problems with %Roar, first check that an authentication token has been assigned as part of player authentication. You can do this by logging the IRoar interface's AuthToken string.
 *
 * If authentication isn't your problem, here's a suggested list of steps you can take to get your problem resolved:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Read the documentation. Available for you is the:<br/>

 *
 * \section unity_sdk_vs_web_api Does the Unity SDK support all the features available to the Web API?
 *
 * There is a Unity to Web API bridge that enables developers to make any call to the Web API, accessible via the IRoar.WebAPI interface; however due to the nature of the roar server responses, it's important that the right events are fired when a WebAPI response is received.
 *
 * The sdk has several levels of abstraction, some features of the web api are exposed at a high level via 'Components' such as the player's inventory or player's properties, whilst other features are exposed at a low level such as interaction with friends. A short code level comparison of the two follows:
 *
 * To get the contents of the player's inventory:
 * <code>
 * roar.Inventory.list()
 * </code>
 *
 * To get the list of player's friends:
 * <code>
 * roar.WebAPI.IFriendsActions.list(Hashtable obj, IRequestCallback<IXMLNode> cb)
 * </code>
 *
 * where the first argument is the options to send to the roar server and the second argument is the callback function to be passed the xml response from the server.
 *
 * It is important in using the low level api to ensure that the correct events are passed to the RoarManager class, one can browse through the component classes in the sdk's Roar.implementation.Components namespace to see examples of this requirement.
 *
 * It should be noted that due to the api's alpha status, the low level api is less stable and more likely to evolve than the high level components interface i.e. you are welcome to use the low level api to leverage features that are not yet implemented as components, however you do so at your own risk, with the knowledge that the low level api may change in the near future.
